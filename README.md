# Decision Tree

Decision tree is one of the supervised learning algorithms that can be used for classification and regression problems. This algorithm is powerful and capable of dealing with complex problems. Decision tree predicts a class (classification) or value (regression) based on rules formed after analyzing the data.

This is a data classification with the decision tree technique using Iris dataset, which contains 150 samples from 3 iris species (Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica). It has 4 attribute columns, namely 'sepal length', 'sepal width', 'petal length', and 'petal width'. In the case of Iris classification, the model predicts the species of an iris based on its attributes. We can also see the visualization of the decision tree that we created for the data using the Graphviz library.
