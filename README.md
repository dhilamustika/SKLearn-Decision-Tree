Data classification with the Decision Tree technique using the Iris dataset


Decision tree is one of the supervised learning algorithms that can be used for classification and regression problems. This algorithm is powerful and able to handle complex problems. Decision tree predicts a class (classification) or value (regression) based on rules formed after analyzing the data.
